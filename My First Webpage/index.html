                </div>
                <p>My name is Jager Cooper and thats a picture of me over there, I am 26, a father of 4, Dock worker for Armour, 4th year University student, and ive been intrigued in technology since i had my first computer back in the time of Battlefield 2 and Limewire (we all know how long thats been), ever since, i've always been quite interested in gaming, software and the capabilities of technology.</p>

                    <h2>My Path Here</h2>
                </div>
                <p>I started my university path in 2018, with no specific goal in mind, through some experience with general studies, an affinity for science and chemistry appeared so i pursued a process engineering degree. After spending some time in the program i realized this is not at all what id like to do for the rest of my life. At this point it hit me how much i love working with computers, games etc, through some research in the field i discovered there's alot of potential to be succesful and I swithced majors happily into something I could spend the next 25 years working at.</p>

                    <h2>Where I Want To Be</h2>
                </div>
                <p>Within the near future I want to be a digital artist; bringing entertainment, services, and apps that make aspects of life easier to people. While continuously doing that I hope to be working a great job at an innovative company learning from practical applications and experts in the field. My ultimate goal is to be the founder of a software developing firm; Solenix Software, consulting with other companies on software they need constructed, creating games and apps for the public to enjoy, and working on innovative technology.</p>

                    <h2>Why I Want To Join Get Coding</h2>
                </div>
                <p>It's been 12 months since I joined Computer Science and I feel like i've barely learned anything along the way, in fact I feel i've learned more on my own. It feels like the program is letting me down, about half of the Credit hours needed to graduate are entirely unrelated to being a programmer and I dont want to waste anymore of my time and effort on the wrong things.</p>
            
                <p>Get Coding seems like the proper direct approach to entering the field of Computer Science, learn through practical application, ive heard great things about the program and i'm entirely ready to commit to setting my career on the right path. Learning through application of skills in a 'job' like setting, creating real projects that interst me, and getting to meet amazing people already in the industry. I have an immense desire to be successful in this industry and I think get coding would work well for me because I believe its the best path to get me where I want to be.</p>
